the week, and demand.  Always check current prices and look for deals online.\n*   **Transportation:** This itinerary assumes a mix of walking, public transportation (the Deuce bus is a cost-effective option), and possibly ride-sharing for places slightly further out.  Factor transportation costs into your budget.\n*   **Food:**  Eating on a budget in Vegas requires some planning.  Look for affordable restaurants, food courts, or consider packing some snacks and drinks.  Happy hour specials are your friend.\n*   **Flexibility:**  This is a suggested itinerary; feel free to adjust it based on your interests and preferences.\n*   **Booking:** Book your hotel and any shows you want to see well in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.\n\nThis JSON structure provides a good starting point for planning your trip. You can further customize it by adding more specific details, such as restaurant suggestions, specific showtimes, and alternative activities.  Remember to check the latest information on opening hours and pricing for all attractions before your trip.  Enjoy your Las Vegas getaway!\n"},
